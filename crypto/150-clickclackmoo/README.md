> 	COWS SPEND MOST OF THE MORNING DIGGING AROUND IN THE GARBAGE BINS. FROM THE OTHER COWS, I HEAR STORIES ABOUT CHICKEN ATTACKS, WHICH AREAS THE POLICE SEEM MOST NERVOUS ABOUT, AND WHICH HAVE STARTED TO RECOVER. THEY TALK ABOUT THE BEST PLACES TO FIND CHEESE, THE BEST PLACES TO FIND GRASS. THE BEST PLACES TO HIDE WHEN CHICKENS INVADE TO EAT LUNCH. FLAG{GAR13AG3_B1N_YUM}
