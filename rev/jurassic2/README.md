## Problem Statement
Hey, welcome back to Jurassic Park. Would you mind checking if the food production center is following all the food regulations? We need our dinosaurs in tip top shape.
Oh, I forgot to mentionâ€”you might need a warrant. Let's hope not, because I don't have one for you.

## Solution
`^` in Python performs the XOR, or exclusive-or, operation. XOR is its own inverse, so in order to reverse this, just XOR it again. In other words, input the desired result (`kbnwjvvuqIu+*|Dssrf]`) into the function and print the output. This prints the flag.

## Flag
`flag{dead_b33f_only}`
