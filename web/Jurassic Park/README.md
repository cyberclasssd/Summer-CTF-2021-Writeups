# Jurassic Park
## Problem Statement
Hey look, I made a new website for Jurassic Park. https://jurassic-park.cyberclass.repl.co/
## Solution
We can navigate to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pages to find three different parts of the flag.

HTML: `<!-- Hello, inspector! Nice job, you found part 1/3 of the flag: flag{jurassi -->`

CSS: `/* Welcome to the CSS page! Here you find all of the magic behind making our website look pretty. Here's part 2/3 of your flag: c_park_has_a_ne */`

JavaScript: `/* This is the end of our tour, inspector! Here you find the code behind different functions of the website. Here's the last part of your flag: w_inspector}*/`
## Flag
`flag{jurassic_park_has_a_new_inspector}`
