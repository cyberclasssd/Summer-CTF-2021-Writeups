## Problem Statement
This is an OSINT challenge! You are a warlock on a quest. You come across a riddling sphinx. "What's my favorite dino?" asks the sphinx.

Hint: you may not have to transcribe this manually.

## Solution
Use an online text extractor tool such as [brandfolder](https://brandfolder.com/workbench/extract-text-from-image) for the gibberish text on the given image, so you don't have to transcribe it by hand.

> 	THERE ARE MANY FANTASTIC DINOSAURS WHO HAVE TRODDEN THIS EARTH. AMONG MT MOST WELL LIKED ARE THE SEISMOSAUR, THE JUDICERATOPS, AND THE HYPSIBEMA MISSOURIENSIS. DINOSAURS ARE LE COOLEST COOL. ESPECIALLY INFLATABSE DINOSAURS. ONCE, 400 MILLION YEARS AGO, I DRESSED UP IN AN INFLATABLE DINOSAUR COSTUME FOR ANUBIS'S BIRTHDAY PARTY. THE COSTUME WAS PINK. THE DINOSAUR IS PINK. DID YOU KNOW ANUBIS HATES PINK? ANUBIS HATES DINOSAURS TOO. ACTUALLY I THINK HE USED TO HATE THEM BUT NOW HE LIKES THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE DEAD. ANYWAY, MY FAVORITE DINOSAUR IS THE STEGO-SAURUS.
